\section{Introduction}

This project was an experiment in writing a server for an online
video game.
The academic goal was to get hands-on experience about designing and building a
complex server from scratch, without missing any aspects of it: from basic blocks
such as networking, cryptography and concurrency to managing the world itself.

This project was done as a part of the Ensimag's second year module `Specialty
project'.
The idea was at the initiative of the students.

\subsection{World of Warcraft}

For such a purpose, we chose the World of Warcraft video game.
In deed, writing our own video game client would have been both out of the scope
of this project and, in terms of time spent, mutually exclusive with writing the
server for it.
Moreover, the video game sector has by nature little to no available open source
game clients that would fit the purpose of this project.
Consequently, it was decided to settle on an existing video game.

With prior knowledge and additional research, World of Warcraft was determined to be the
video game for which writing a server would be most interesting: being the most
popular and populous game of its type for the last decade, the technical aspects
were certain to be production grade. Furthermore, the protocol is well
documented and there exists very advanced open source implementations of it.

\subsubsection{Disclaimer}

World of Warcraft is proprietary software.
Regular players pay a monthly subscription fee.
This project is only done as a learning experience, by students in a fully
academic context.
In other words, this is a research project with no goals whatsoever towards
facilitating copyright infringement.

This project is under the MIT license, as found in the repository's root folder.

\subsection{General information about MMORPGs}

MMORPGs are exclusively online video games: without a network connection, the
game cannot be played. Unlike more traditionnal games such as first-person
shooters, the players evolve in a fully shared persistent open world.

In these games, the server is authoritative: in real time, each player tells of
its actions to the server, which authorizes them and then sends out the
information to the other players (for example, players will be informed when a
nearby players attack a creature).
In terms of network topology, this model is known as the star model, in which
every communication goes through a central server.

On a non-technical note, for the players of such game, the goals are often about
creating a character and making it stronger, e.g.\ by fighting creatures and
gaining equipment.

\subsection{Stated objectives}

This project was done as a part of the Ensimag's module named `Speciality
project'.
With World of Warcraft's development budget numbering in millions of dollars and
a single semester of classes at our disposal, it was obvious that only a minimal
subset of features from the original game server could be implemented.\

The features to be implemented are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentication
    \item Realm selection
    \item Character creation
    \item Joining the world
    \item Movement
    \item Seeing other players move
\end{itemize}

While all these features are extremely basic and are all-together insufficient
for anyone to consider actually playing the game, they did provide enough work
to last until the end of the project.

\subsection{TrinityCore}

TrinityCore is an open source project for a game server that is compatible with
the World of Warcraft client.
Unlike our implementation, their codebase is nearly 13 years old (through many
forks) and provides a playing experience that is much closer (yet still not
equal) to the official experience.

The reverse engineering work was primarily done by this project and its
predecessors, which is why we felt it was important to give them a special
mention here.\\

However, a codebase that is as old as TrinityCore is bound to have some
flaws. Indeed, modern considerations, for example on distributed systems,
scalability or open source code base management, did not exist when most of the
work on TrinityCore was done.

Though TrinityCore was indeed an inspiration for this project, our goal is not
to simply translate code from C++ to Scala.
With the usage of Scala and Akka actors, we intend to have a scalable and
eventually distributed solution with a clean and hopefully elegant codebase.

\subsection{Packet handler actor hierarchy}

At the start of the RealmServer, using reflection (as done for the REST API),
actors implementing the \texttt{PayloadHandlerFactory} trait are instantiated
and a map associating each packet to the matching handler is built.

Once a packet has arrived to the realm server and been deserialized
successfully, its payload is passed to the correct handler.
As an example of what a handler might do, the character enumeration request
handler will load all characters for an account and build the responding packet.

Note that the packet handlers actors are by design choice fully stateless: this
has the benefit of allowing us to scale them out individually simply by adding a
load balancing actor in front of one.

\subsection{Connection}

After the authentication server phase, the client and game server are both in
possession of a cryptographically secure random shared secret.
The client establishes a new TCP connection to the server and sends an initial
packet telling the server which account is being used for authentication.

\subsubsection{Cryptography}

The server retrieves the cryptographic key associated with the account from the
database.

The algorithm used in the version of protocol we support (from
2009) is RC4a (symmetric encryption) which is now known to be flawed.
The variant used in the World of Warcraft protocol skips the first 1024 bytes,
which are known to leak information.
The cipher is initialized using the shared secret.

From that point onwards, the secret is used as an encryption key for all
communications.
However, it must be noted that only the headers of every packet
(and not the contents itself) are encrypted.

\subsubsection{Actor hierarchy}

From the server side, once a TCP connection is received, a
\texttt{NetworkWorker} actor is created by the TCP handler actor.
This actor's responsibility is to handle all aspects of networking for a client:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Receive incoming packets, decrypt them if appliable, deserialize them
        and pass them to the correct packet handler
    \item Serialize outgoing packets, encrypt them if appliable and send them
        over the network
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{NetworkWorker} then creates a \texttt{Session} actor, which is
responsible for maintaining all state related to the current game client.
However, it does not handle anything related to the player being in the world.

\subsection{Characters management}


\subsection{World state}

\subsubsection{Event stream}

As actions in the game must be visible for other characters, there needs to
be a way to send messages to a set of players.

On the official implementation of World of Warcraft, with the expected
workloads, it would be necessary to separate the world is small subset that have
much more workable sizes, e.g.\ by iterating only on units which are in the
players field of view.

In our simplified implementation, however, we can ignore these constraints as
our number of players is expected to be very small.\\

As a common communication channel between all actors of the world, we use Akka's
\texttt{EventStream}, which is an advanced implementation of the
publisher/subscriber pattern: it offers subscribers ability to filter on the
types of messages they want to receive.

\subsubsection{WorldState actor}

The \texttt{WorldState} actor's responsibility is to maintain knowledge about
the current state of the world.
In our case, this means:
\begin{itemize}
    \item gathering changes to the world, e.g.\ a player joining
    \item maintaining the current state of the world using those changes, e.g.\
        having a list of all players currently in the world
    \item and `ticking' the world
\end{itemize}

Ticking the world is an action that happens at a very small interval (30
milliseconds).
When the world is ticked, actions that took place during the last 30
milliseconds are grouped together and sent out to all clients in form of the
\texttt{ServerObjectUpdate} packet.
Some actions, for example movements which require more real time handling,
are not part of the events gathered for a world tick. However, an example of an
event that is gathered is a player joining the world:
\begin{itemize}
    \item for the player itself, the packet would contain information about it's
        own character, such as it's looks, current statistics and initial
        position and all the other players that are already in world
    \item for other players, the packet would contain similiar information,
        telling them that a new player has spawned at some position
\end{itemize}

For that process, the \texttt{WorldState} actor gathers events and then
publishes a \texttt{DispatchWorldUpdate} event to the event stream. All
\texttt{SessionPlayer} actors are subscribed to this event, and use the contents
(the events that happened during the last tick) to build the
\texttt{ServerObjectUpdate} packet.

\subsubsection{Joining the world}

When a player has selected it's character and joined the world, the
\texttt{ClientPlayerLogin} packet is sent by the client.

The \texttt{PlayerLoginHandler} actor then sends an event to the \texttt{Session}
actor, containing the id of the selected character.
Initially, all features related to the in-game character were handled by the
\texttt{Session} actor.

However, to enforce the single responsibility principle, it was decided to move
this responsibility to a separator actor, \texttt{SessionPlayer} that is created
by the \texttt{Session} actor once the client has selected its player.\\

Upon it's creation, the \texttt{SessionPlayer} actor publishes a
\texttt{PlayerJoined} event to the event stream.  
On the next world tick, this event will be a part of the
\texttt{DispatchWorldUpdate} message received by all \texttt{SessionPlayer}
actors (including the sender).
As written earlier, the client will know about its own character when receiving
the initial \texttt{ServerObjectUpdate} which will this information.\\

However, a player joining the world must also know about existing players. To
handle that case, the \texttt{SessionPlayer} sends when created a
\texttt{GetWorldState} message to the \texttt{WorldState} actor, which answers
with a list of players of players currently in world.

This additional information is used when building the first
\texttt{ServerObjectUpdate} packet, such that the client will have knowledge of
all players currently in world.

\subsection{Player movement}

There are various messages in the protocol used for movement.
All of them have the same structure but use a different opcode, indicating what
type of movement is being done.
As the movements require direct handling instead of waiting for the next world
tick, the messages are received by the \texttt{MovementHandler}, are adapted for
network lag and directly forwarded to all the clients through, which is done by
publish a \texttt{PlayerMoved} event to the event stream.
The event is received by all \texttt{NetworkWorker} actor, who send the packet
to the client.

Lag compensation is a simple process.
The client regularly (every 10 seconds) synchronizes its local time with the
server's time.
When the packet is emitted by the client, it is tagged with the emission time.
On reception by the server, the difference between the server's time and the
packet's time gives a rough estimation of the time it took for the packet to
travel from the client to the server. 
This difference is added to the packet's time tag before it is sent back to
the clients.

\subsection{Interesting challenges ahead}

The featureset that is currently implemented is very limited, and a lot of the
time was spent on necessary and yet unavoidable boilerplate code.
The environment of an MMORPG server however offers a lot of potential for
challenging code situations.
For the future of this project, on which we intend to continue to work, we
feel like the following features would be interesting challenges.

\subsubsection{Basic game play features}

While not directly technically complex, add more game feature makes for a
richer environment. In a highly concurrent architecture like ours, and with more
feature meaning more data, it is a challenge to design data management in a way
that is both correct (i.e.\ no concurrency issues) and scalable.

These features could be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit fields (required for almost everything else, we managed to avoid
        this complex feature for the duration of the project)
    \item Spell casting
    \item \gls{NPC}
\end{itemize}

These basic features also serve as openings for more technically interesting
features.

\subsection{Non playing characters}

Adding non-players characters to the game opens up a lot of interesting
challenges.
Indeed, with many creatures on a map, it would be impossible in the time of a
single world tick to iterate on all of them.
Moreover, it would also be pointless, as a player is limited in the amount of
information it can display on screen.

As such, it is interesting to discuss ways to split up the world in smaller
pieces.
Of course, as the World of Warcraft client and player perceives the world
as one big continuous space, it's not possible to put hard barriers between
these smaller pieces.
A common approach is to layer the world with a grid, where every entity belongs
to a cell. As entities (even creatures) can move freely between different cells 
of the grid, keeping the grid up to date in real time is a task in itself,
specially with a concurrent environment.

Generally speaking, this field of research is known as spatial indices.

\subsection{Distributed application}

As it currently stands, our application only benefits from `vertical scaling':
the only way bigger workloads can be handled, ignoring better code, is by using
faster hardware.
For production software, this is insufficient as hardware progress is slow
and costly.

Horizontal scaling means that the application can take advantage of additional
computers.
In our case, Akka supports horizontal scaling: it is possible for an
\texttt{ActorSystem} to be spread amongst multiple machines (Akka Cluster
containing Akka Nodes).
However, it's not automatic and it is the programmer's responsibility to
correctly assign actors to nodes.
Indeed, having actors that communicate a lot on different nodes will incur
serialization and network overhead for every message, which would result in a
loss of performance.\\

As World of Warcraft is an open world that is continuous from the point of view
of the player, isolating groups of actors is difficult.
However, there exists a few hard borders which can be used.
The main one is continents. The main world, in the version we support, is split
in four main continents (named Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Northrend and
Outland).

There is little communication between those continents: most actors of a
contient (creatures, various game objects) are created and will always reside
within said continent.

Players can switch continents, but it is not seamless as it requires a loading
screen on the client's side.
Thus, moving a Player's actor from one continent's node to another would
cause little issue.

Some actions (like chat, groups, guilds, instances, battlegrounds\ldots) 
require interacting with a player whose actor is on a different node.
As these actions are not real time, node crossing overhead is not an issue.

One remaining issue is that the client currently uses a single TCP connection,
therefore there has to be a front end server through which all network data
will pass.
For production grade software with actual players, how much latency such a proxy
would add depends on a lot of factors, e.g.\ the cluster's hardware
configuration.

For a technical demonstration such as this project however, this issue is
ignored.

\subsection{Raycasting}

When two entities of the world are interacting with one another, they most of
the time must have line of sight on one another.
Concretely, it would not make sense to be able to cast spells on a creature from
behind a wall.
A common problem is knowing who is in line of sight of whom in real time.

Solving this problem implies loading the maps in memory of the world, which in
itself is already complicated due to the associated reverse engineering
challenges.
There are then well-known algorithms to check for line of sight.

An interesting part of this approach would be to split off the actors
responsible for this work to another machine. With a low enough network latency
(e.g. InfiniBand) and a machine with hardware optimised for such
calculations (e.g.\ multiple GPUs if the calculations lend themselves well to
to GPU computing), this design could offer improvements in scalability.

This is also way to open up to the domain of `server-side world physics'.
